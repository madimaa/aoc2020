# Advent of Code 2020
https://adventofcode.com/2020

Last year I learned GoLang by doing AdventOfCode.  
This year I wanted to continue this journey.  
So here I am. :)  

Have fun humans! :)

 - Most of my codes are overcomplicated and ugly, I know. Maybe one day I will clean up the repo, probably I won't. :)
 - If you try your input with this repo and it gives you a wrong answer, please create a discussion or an issue, and attach your input. Thanks! :)
