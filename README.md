# Advent of Code 2020
https://adventofcode.com/2020

Last year I learned GoLang by doing AdventOfCode.  
This year I wanted to continue this journey.  
So here I am.

Have fun humans! :)

 - Most of my codes are overcomplicated and ugly, I know. Maybe one day I will clean up the repo, probably I won't.
 - If you try your input with this repo and it gives you a wrong answer, please create a discussion or an issue, and attach your input. Thanks! :)

 - I was so happy that I made it, I forgot to commit my day 25 solution. 🤦🏻‍♂️
 - I really liked this year's Advent of Code, unfortunately, last year I didn't get to the end.
 - My skills improved in a year or the puzzles were easier, I don't know. But I genuinely enjoyed coding and figuring out the most of them.
 - Thank you [Eric Wastl](https://github.com/topaz) for this adventure.
